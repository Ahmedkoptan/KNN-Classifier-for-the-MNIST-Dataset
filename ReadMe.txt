Training on 10000 training images and testing 100 testing images
- Corresponding file is KNN.m file
- The K parameter is specified before the testing loop and can be changed
- Takes almost 30 minutes to finish running, but yields very low % error compared to Linear Regression
- ‘scalars’ matrix stores distance for one testing image between all training samples
- percentage error is output in the end
- K is set to 13, since it yields only 4% error.
